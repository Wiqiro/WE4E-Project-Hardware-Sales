# Website coding project: LDLD

### About the project

This project was realized for the WE4A module at UTBM.
It is a simple hardware sales website that uses the basic web technologies (deadline of one month).

### Get started

You'll need to import the SQL database in MySQL.
The database should be created automatically with the name "imbert-chanson".

You'll then need to copy the source code into your web server.

You should now be good to go !
